Alone and disoriented, Thor is besieged by Loki’s followers, hell-bent on stopping him…at any cost. Enlisting the help of a female human companion, Thor fights his way North, in search of his mythical weapon. Finding his hammer, Thor’s identity and prowess are restored and he must now prepare himself for a final climactic battle with Loki, to prevent the overthrow of the universe.",3.962,/dm5F3h7Wtr8yFGJtjdodHMUJfPC.jpg,"[{'id': 22463, 'logo_path': None, 'name': 'Still Night Monster Movies', 'origin_country': 'US'}]","[{'iso_3166_1': 'US', 'name': 'United States of America'}]",2015-05-06,0.0,91.0,"[{'english_name': 'English', 'iso_639_1': 'en', 'name': 'English'}, {'english_name': 'Thai', 'iso_639_1': 'th', 'name': 'ภาษาไทย'}]",Released,The last hope for mankind.,God of Thunder,0.0,4.192,13.0,PG-13,2015

It unfolds over a single day and follows an 11-year-old boy’s relentless quest to profess his love to a girl in his class. As the invasion encroaches on Beirut, it upends the day, threatening the entire country and its cohesion. Within the microcosm of the school, the film draws a harrowing portrait of a society torn between its desire for love and peace and the ideological schisms unraveling its seams.  In his debut feature, director Oualid Mouaness delivers an ode to innocence in which he revisits one of the most cataclysmic moments in Lebanon's history through the lens of a child and his vibrant imagination.
